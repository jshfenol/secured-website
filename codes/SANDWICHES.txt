<h1>SANDWICHES</h1>

<p><b>Common Folk’s Ham and Cheese Cubano<br>(P260)</b><br><br><image src="ham and cheese.jpg" height="350" width="650"><br>
Common Folk’s sandwiches are brimming with fillings and packed with flavor, and their Cubano is no exception. This take on the classic Cuban ham and cheese sandwich is tangier, with ham, cheese, pickles, and honey mustard stuffed between toasted crusty bread.</p><br><br>
<p><b>Stockwell Café + Lounge’s Buffalo Chicken Sandwich<br>(P235)</b><br><br><image src="stockwell.jpg" height="350" width="650"><br>
Stockwell Café’s Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is, as owner Sherwin Choi puts it, “deconstructed then reconstructed Buffalo chicken wings." You get the chicken, fried until golden brown then slathered with traditional spicy wings sauce. There's also the coleslaw, which is cool and mildly sweet to balance out the heat, all sandwiched between panini-toasted bread.</p><br><br>
<p><b>Fundamental Coffee’s Seared Tuna Avocado<br>(P295)</b><br><br><image src="Fundamental.jpg" height="350" width="650"><br>
If you've never had tuna and avocado together in a sandwich, then Fundamental Coffee's Seared Tuna Avocado is a great introduction. Fresh tuna and creamy avocado make for a surprisingly good blend, coming together for a rich and tasty filling that goes well with the soft bread and a side of potato crisps.</p><br><br>
<p><b>Chicken Parm from Bucky's<br> (P250)</b><br><br><image src="bucky.jpg" height="350" width="650"><br>
 The Chicken Parm fillet at Bucky's is so hefty, it’s ready to burst out of its ciabatta casing. The generous layers of mozzarella and marinara sauce keep the sandwich moist and flavorful, and is perfectly proportioned so they don’t overwhelm your palate (and leave a mess on your lap).</p><br><br>
<p><b>Tilde Handcraft Café’s Kimchee Reuben<br>(P350)</b><br><br><image src="Tilde.jpg" height="350" width="650"><br>
Tilde’s take on the classic Reuben sandwich is an unforgettable explosion of flavors. The bold savory flavor of their house-cured corned beef is elevated by the distinct tang of kimchi and balanced out with the sweetness of sliced pears.</p><br><br>
