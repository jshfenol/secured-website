It’s an excellent rendition of a classic, with a deep and dark chocolate flavor, uber-moist cake base, and thick coffee custard that brings out the flavor of the chocolate.</p><br><br>
<p><b>Sea Salted Honey Crunch cake</b><br>(P770)<br><br><image src="caramia.jpg" height="350" width="650"><br>
which features the combo of mocha and caramel, with fluffy chiffon-cake layers, a light mocha-cream filling, and a sea-salted honey crunch that adds just the right amount of savoriness to balance all the flavors out.</p><br><br>
<p><b>Butter Caramel Cake</b><br>(P400)<br><br><image src="caramel cake.jpg" height="350" width="650"><br>
This cake highlights the rich and buttery taste of caramel in the form of a butter cake topped with their signature caramel sauce—perfect by itself, or with a cup of good coffee on the side.</p><br><br>
